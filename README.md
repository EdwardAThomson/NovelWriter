# NovelWriter

## Description

NovelWriter is a comprehensive Python application designed to assist authors in writing novels and short stories across **multiple genres** by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a GUI-based interface built with Tkinter for managing novel parameters, generating universe lore, outlining story structure, planning scenes, and writing chapter prose. The application now features an advanced agentic framework with multi-agent orchestration and a multi-level review system for quality control.

**🎯 Supported Genres:**

- **Sci-Fi** (Space Opera, Hard Sci-Fi, Cyberpunk, Time Travel, Post-Apocalyptic, Biopunk)
- **Fantasy** (High Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Urban Fantasy, Sword and Sorcery, Mythic Fantasy, Fairy Tale)
- **Historical Fiction** (Ancient History, Medieval, Renaissance, Colonial America, Civil War Era, World War Era)
- **Horror** (Gothic Horror, Psychological Horror, Supernatural Horror, Body Horror, Cosmic Horror, Slasher)
- **Mystery** (Cozy Mystery, Hard-boiled Detective, Police Procedural, Amateur Sleuth, Legal Thriller, Forensic Mystery)
- **Romance** (Contemporary Romance, Historical Romance, Paranormal Romance, Romantic Suspense, Regency Romance, Western Romance)
- **Thriller** (Espionage Thriller, Psychological Thriller, Action Thriller, Techno-Thriller, Medical Thriller, Legal Thriller)
- **Western** (Traditional Western, Weird Western, Space Western, Modern Western, Outlaw Western, Cattle Drive Western)

Each genre features specialized faction generation, character creation, and world-building tailored to genre conventions and tropes.

The application features a dynamic LLM model selector, allowing users to choose from various supported models for different generation tasks. Currently configured models include:

*   OpenAI GPT-4o, o1, o1-mini o3, o4-mini
*   Gemini 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 pro
*   Claude 3.5, 3.7 Sonnet
*   *(You can add/remove models by configuring `ai_helper.py`)*

Running this code requires API keys for the specific LLMs you intend to use (e.g., an **OpenAI API key** for GPT models, a **Google AI API key** for Gemini models, **Anthropic API Key** for Claude models). These keys should be stored in a `.env` file in the project's root directory.

While many steps are automated, the output often serves as a strong starting point that can be further refined by the author.

Each example includes the complete workflow outputs showing all intermediate generation steps, from initial parameters through to final prose, demonstrating how the structured approach produces coherent long-form fiction.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EdwardAThomson/NovelWriter.git
    cd NovelWriter
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
It might easiest to open the files in an IDE and let it handle virtual environments automatically.
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * (or `pip install openai python-dotenv google-generativeai anthropic`)
    
4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your API keys to this file in the following format:
        
        ```dotenv
        OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
        GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_api_key_here'
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_anthropic_api_key_here'
        ```
    *   Replace the placeholder text with your actual keys.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 🔧 Utility Scripts

### `combine.py` -- build the novel file

Located in the root directory, this script is used to combine all generated chapter markdown files (typically found in `current_work/chapters/`) into a single markdown file. The output file is named after the novel's title (if found in `parameters.txt`) or defaults to `combined_novel.md`, and is saved within the `current_work/chapters/` directory. This is useful for creating a complete manuscript from individual chapter files.

## 🚀 The Generation Process

The novel generation process follows these main stages through the UI tabs:

### Original Version

The original version was created as part of NaNoGenMo 2024 ([**completed**](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2024/issues/31)). The first version of the code was pushed to a different repo as I lost access to my GitHub account (fixed!), please find the original repo here: [NovelWriter](https://github.com/edthomson/NovelWriter). That code was not fully automated, but it did generate a 52,000-word novel (Echoes of Terra Nova).
