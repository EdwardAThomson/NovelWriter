# Chapter Writing Review System - Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive multi-level review system for automated chapter writing

---

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding comprehensive review functionality to the Chapter Writing Agent. The system will use local analysis (no LLM calls) to provide fast, frequent quality assessment at multiple levels.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ Existing Capabilities
- **Automated Chapter Writing**: Full chapter generation with scene-by-scene prose
- **Progress Tracking**: Chapter completion status and batch processing
- **Structure Analysis**: Support for all story structures and short stories
- **Local Review Agent**: Existing review framework with local analysis only

### ❌ Missing Capabilities
- **No Scene-Level Reviews**: No quality assessment after individual scenes
- **No Chapter-Level Reviews**: No coherence checking after chapter completion
- **No Cross-Chapter Analysis**: No consistency tracking across multiple chapters
- **No Quality Metrics Storage**: No persistent quality data for analysis
- **No Retry Logic**: No automatic improvement based on quality scores

## 🏗️ Proposed Directory Structure

### 📁 Current Issues with `current_work/`
- All files dumped in root directory (20+ files mixed together)
- No organization by content type or workflow step
- Difficult to find specific files
- No separation of generated content vs metadata
- Review data mixed with story content

### 📁 Proposed New Structure

## 🔍 Review System Architecture

### 📊 Multi-Level Review Strategy

#### 1. Scene-Level Reviews
**Trigger**: After each scene generation  
**Frequency**: Every scene (high frequency)  
**Performance**: Fast (local analysis only)

**Metrics to Track**:
- **Scene Length**: Word count, paragraph count, appropriate length for scene type
- **Content Balance**: Dialogue vs narrative ratio, action vs description balance
- **Character Presence**: Character mentions, dialogue distribution, character development
- **Plot Advancement**: Plot element introduction, conflict progression, tension building
- **Language Quality**: Vocabulary variety, sentence structure, readability
- **Scene Coherence**: Internal consistency, logical flow, scene completion

**Output Location**: `quality/reviews/scene_reviews/chapter_{num}_scene_{num}_review.json`

#### 2. Chapter-Level Reviews
**Trigger**: After complete chapter generation  
**Frequency**: Every chapter (medium frequency)  
**Performance**: Fast (local analysis only)

**Metrics to Track**:
- **Chapter Structure**: Scene count, scene transitions, chapter arc completion
- **Cross-Scene Coherence**: Character consistency across scenes, setting continuity
- **Pacing Analysis**: Scene length variation, tension progression, chapter flow
- **Character Development**: Character arc progression within chapter
- **Plot Progression**: Plot thread advancement, conflict escalation
- **Style Consistency**: Writing style uniformity, tone consistency

**Output Location**: `quality/reviews/chapter_reviews/chapter_{num}_review.json`

#### 3. Batch-Level Reviews
**Trigger**: After batch of chapters (e.g., every 3 chapters)  
**Frequency**: Every batch (low frequency)  
**Performance**: Moderate (more comprehensive analysis)

**Metrics to Track**:
- **Cross-Chapter Consistency**: Character trait consistency, timeline continuity
- **Story Progression**: Overall plot advancement, pacing across chapters
- **Character Development**: Character arc progression across multiple chapters
- **World Consistency**: Setting details, world-building consistency
- **Style Evolution**: Writing style changes, tone shifts
- **Plot Thread Tracking**: Introduction, development, and resolution of plot threads

**Output Location**: `quality/reviews/batch_reviews/batch_{num}_review.json`

    # ... existing scene generation logic ...
    
    # NEW: Scene-level review
    scene_review = self._review_scene(
        chapter_num, scene_num, generated_prose, context
    )
    
    # Store review data
    self._save_scene_review(scene_review)
    
    # Optional: Retry logic based on quality
    if scene_review.retry_recommended and self.auto_retry_enabled:
        return self._retry_scene_generation(chapter_num, scene_num, scene_plan, context)
    
    return generated_prose
```

**2. Chapter Completion Integration**
```python
def _write_single_chapter(self, chapter_info):
    # ... existing chapter generation logic ...
    
    # NEW: Chapter-level review
    chapter_review = self._review_chapter(
        chapter_info.chapter_number, final_content, context
    )
    
    # Store review data
    self._save_chapter_review(chapter_review)
    
    # Update quality metrics
    self._update_quality_metrics(chapter_review)
    
    return result
```

**3. Batch Processing Integration**
```python
def write_chapters_batch(self, chapter_info_list, plan):
    # ... existing batch writing logic ...
    
    # NEW: Batch-level review
    if len(chapters_written) >= self.batch_review_threshold:
        batch_review = self._review_chapter_batch(chapters_written)
        self._save_batch_review(batch_review)
        self._generate_quality_reports()
    
    return result
