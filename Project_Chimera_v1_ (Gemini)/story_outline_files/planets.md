## Planets in Project Chimera

* **Old Earth (Sol III):**  The original homeworld, now a gleaming metropolis-planet governed by the Global Stellar Federation (GSF).  Overpopulated and meticulously controlled, it serves as the political and technological heart of the Federation.  Resources are tightly managed, leading to a stratified society and resentment from the outer colonies.

* **Elysium (Aethel IV):**  A young agrarian colony struggling for self-sufficiency and independence from Old Earth's control. Known for its vast farmlands and a more rugged, frontier-like culture. Elara's homeworld.

* **Volcanic Moon of Xylos (Xylos I-b):** A moon undergoing active terraforming, presenting a harsh environment of volcanic activity and unstable terrain.  Likely the location of a crucial research outpost or resource extraction operation.

* **Aethel Prime (Aethel I):** A gas giant in the Aethel system that Elysium orbits. Possibly mined for resources or used for atmospheric processing.

* **Trading Hub of Kepler-186f (Kepler-186f):** A planet bustling with trade and commerce among various species. This could serve as a crossroads for information and a meeting point for Elara and her allies, including the alien traders. Serves as a neutral ground outside direct GSF control.

* **The Architect Homeworld (Unknown System/Designation):**  A lost or hidden planet, potentially in a different galaxy or dimension, which once housed the Architects. This location could be the source of the Whispers and the key to understanding their advanced technology and the nature of consciousness.

* **The Quarantine Zone (Undisclosed Location):** A restricted area, possibly a planet or a section of space, under strict GSF control. It could house dangerous technologies, rebellious AIs, or entities related to the Architects, and might be where Elara is ultimately headed or attempting to avoid.
